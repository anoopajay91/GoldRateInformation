This script was used by me to send gold rate information everyday to certain mobile numbers and email addresses.

Have used way2sms to send the SMS and Gmail in order to send the mails.

In order to wake up the system everyday at a particular time, have made the setting in 
BIOS. Once the system wakes up, it runs the py file that has been scheduled to run already (Task scheduler).

Have fun :)
